Library Book Tracker System

You are tasked with developing a Java program to manage a collection of book titles in a library. The library maintains a catalogue of books, and it's crucial that each book title appears only once in the collection. To enforce this uniqueness and ensure efficient operations, a HashSet will be used to store the titles.

The program should allow the librarian to:

Add book titles to the collection.

Search for a specific title to check if it's available.

Remove a specified title from the collection.

Display the current collection before and after deletion.

Input Format:

The first line should contain an integer representing the number of book titles to be added.

The next n lines should each contain a book title to be added to the set.

The following line should contain a String â€” the title to be searched.

The final line should contain a String â€” the title to be removed.

ðŸ”¸ Output Format:

Print all book titles in the set (before deletion), each on a new line.

Display whether the search title was found or not found in the set.

If the title to be deleted is in the set, delete it and print a message confirming deletion.

Finally, display all book titles in the set after the deletion.

The order of the books printed may vary as HashSet does not maintain insertion order.
