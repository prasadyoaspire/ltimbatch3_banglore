Library Book Information System (Using HashMap):

Problem Description:

You are tasked with developing a Java program to manage a collection of book titles along with their authors in a library system. Each book title must be unique, and each is associated with an author name.

To store and manage the book data efficiently, the program should use a HashMap<String, String>, where:

The key is the book title.

The value is the author's name.

The system should allow the librarian to:

Add books (title + author) to the collection.

Search for a book by title and display the author if found.

Remove a book by title.

Display the current collection before and after deletion.

Input Format:

The first line contains an integer n â€” the number of books to be added.

The next n lines each contain a book's title and author separated by a comma (,)
Example: The Alchemist,Paulo Coelho

The next line contains a book title to search.

The final line contains a book title to delete.

ðŸ”¸ Output Format:

Print all books in the collection before deletion in the format:
Title: <title>, Author: <author>

Indicate whether the searched book was found or not found.

Indicate whether the deletion was successful or not.

Print all books after deletion.
